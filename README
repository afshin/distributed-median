During an interview, I was asked about how to implement a distributed algorithm
that would calculate the median of a list of numbers distributed over multiple
machines. No one machine can hold all of the data. This demo shows an
"omniscient" supermachine that knows all the data on the left-hand side and
simulated multiple machines on the right-hand side that implement the
distributed median algorithm. I think it's a really good question.
